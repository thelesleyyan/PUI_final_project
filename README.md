# PUI_final_project

This is the final project of 05-430 Programming Usable Interfaces. I made a personal portfolio website.

c. Description: 
  The purpose of my website is to present my experience in UX/UI and design. The primary information is my projects which include a cover page, a title, and a short description. On my website, all projects that I have done are displayed in a two-column grid. The website is interesting because it is responsive and there is a light/dark mode toggle for users to shift the color palette. It is also engaging because of the animations and rotating 3D models. It helps target audiences like job recruiters and school instructors to understand my skill set.

d. Interaction
  -Hover to zoom in animation: hover the cursor over the cover page of every project, the cover image will zoom in.
  -Hover to fade animation: hover the cursor over the cover page of every project, the cover image will fade a little.
  -Click to slide in animation: click a new page to see content to slide in.
  -Light/dark mode: click the moon/sun icon to change the color palette of the page. 
  -Links to click for company and college information: click the underlined text to go to external links. 

e. External libraries
  -I used Bootstrap. I chose it because it is an open-source framework for responsive web development. It helps me to make the website responsive while keeping the grid layout. I use it to set up the layout of my website, and it adds consistency to my website. 
  -I used jQuery. I chose it because it is a lightweight and feature-rich library to manipulate HTML documents. It helps me to make some interesting animations. It gives instant feedback to my users so they feel confident and encouraged to interact with my website. 
  -I used Spline. I chose it because it is a lightweight 3D designing tool. I used it to make rotating 3D models and import to my website with iframe. Compared with static images, it makes my website more interesting and engaging. 
  
f. Iteration from HW7
  -Added an introduction part before displaying all the projects. 
  -Added a design page. 
  -Changed the icon color to white for dark mode. 
  -Added a description line under every project title. 

g. Major Challenges
  -One major challenge is to convert content on Figma to the website. On Figma it is easy to follow a grid, but on the website I need to learn about and use Bootstrap to do so. 
  -Another challenge is to use the 3D model I made in Spine. It is not easy to make it rotating and embedded with the right dimension, and most of the tutorials are using Webflow to import. I finally figure that out with iframe.
